## 1. Embedding the Rule in Settings  

Use a small YAML front-matter block at the top of your AI-settings file. It captures all the metadata you’ll need for versioning, auditing, searchability, and programmatic access:

```yaml
# settings/rules/mobile_first_interaction.yml

id:                mobile_first_interaction_20250708
version:           1.0.0
date_created:      2025-07-08
last_updated:      2025-07-08
author:            UX Team
status:            draft       # or “active” / “deprecated”
keywords:          [mobile-first, responsive, touch, ux, design]
description:       >
  Enforce designing for mobile touch interactions before scaling to desktop.
```  

•  **id**: A lowercase slug with a date suffix for uniqueness.  
•  **version**: Semantic versioning.  
•  **date_created** / **last_updated**: Track your rule’s lifecycle.  
•  **status**: Helps signal adoption stage.  
•  **keywords**: Tag for searching or filtering.  
•  **description**: One-line summary.

## 2. Full Design Principle: Mobile-First Interaction Design  

```yaml
---
id:                mobile_first_interaction_20250708
version:           1.0.0
date_created:      2025-07-08
last_updated:      2025-07-08
author:            UX Team
status:            draft
keywords:          [mobile-first, responsive, touch, ux, design]
title:             Mobile-First Interaction Design

```

### Purpose  

Ensure that all user interfaces are conceived and validated on the smallest, most constrained screens first—prioritizing touch capabilities—before progressively enhancing toward desktop and mouse interactions.

### Core Tenets  

1.  Focus on Constraints  
    - Build for limited screen real estate, slower networks, lower CPU.  
    - Force prioritization: essential content and actions only.  

2.  Touch-Ready by Default  
    - Tap targets ≥ 44×44 px.  
    - Support primary gestures: tap, swipe, pinch, long-press.  
    - Ensure no hidden controls that rely on hover.  

3.  Progressive Enhancement  
    - Start with a base HTML/CSS experience that works on any device.  
    - Layer on media-queries, touch-specific CSS, then desktop‐only adjustments.  
    - Gracefully degrade when JavaScript fails or is disabled.  

4.  Performance as a Feature  
    - Lazy-load images and assets.  
    - Minimize render-blocking code.  
    - Optimize for 2G/3G networks and low-end hardware.  

5.  Accessibility & Inclusion  
    - Ensure screen readers announce all controls.  
    - Provide sufficient color contrast.  
    - Validate with keyboard‐only navigation (some users emulate touch via keyboard).  

### Implementation Checklist  

- [ ] Wireframes & prototypes first on mobile viewport (320–480 px).  
- [ ] Define all touch interactions in a gesture library.  
- [ ] Use emulators **and** real devices for functional testing.  
- [ ] Add responsive breakpoints incrementally (tablet → desktop).  
- [ ] Run Lighthouse or similar audits for performance and accessibility.  
- [ ] Document any desktop-only functionalities as progressive enhancements.  

### Validation Strategy  

1.  Automated QA  
    - Integrate mobile‐first lint rules (e.g., enforce min-tap-target sizes).  
    - CI checks for missing viewport meta, uncompressed assets.  

2.  Manual Testing  
    - Test on physical phones across OS versions.  
    - Validate gestures with real users or QA squads.  

3.  Metrics & Monitoring  
    - Track Core Web Vitals on mobile vs desktop.  
    - Monitor touch-input error rates (mis-taps).  

### Examples & Case Studies  

- Spotify Mobile App: Prioritized swipe gestures in navigation before desktop redesign.  
- Airbnb: Streamlined booking flow to fit a one-screen checkout, then expanded features for web.  

### Next Steps  

- Review and adopt this principle across all new projects.  
- Migrate existing components by auditing mobile touch readiness.  
- Schedule quarterly reviews to bump version and update best practices.  
- Integrate rule into your AI’s decision engine, using the `id` for programmatic reference.
